## Key Quality Metrics

### 1. Template-to-Template Registration
- **Method**: ANTs SyN registration between MNI template spaces
- **Quality Check**: Visual inspection of aligned atlases in `registration_qc/`
- **Expected**: Smooth, anatomically plausible transformations

### 2. Atlas Overlap Analysis
- **Hierarchical Priority**: Levinson > Tian > Destrieux
- **Overlap Statistics**: Detailed in `qc_overlays/overlap_statistics.csv`
- **Expected**: Minimal overlaps, primarily at anatomical boundaries

### 3. Centroid Validation
- **Metric**: Euclidean distance between original and final region centroids
- **Threshold**: <2mm acceptable, <1mm excellent
- **Analysis**: Statistical summaries in `centroid_validation/`

## Expert Review Checklist

- [ ] Registration quality: Check `registration_qc/*.png` for anatomical plausibility
- [ ] Overlap patterns: Review `qc_overlays/overlap_analysis.png` for expected boundaries
- [ ] Centroid accuracy: Verify `centroid_validation/*_analysis.png` shows <95% regions <2mm
- [ ] Template alignment: Confirm proper MNI2009c space alignment
- [ ] Hierarchical priority: Verify brainstem nuclei (Levinson) take precedence

## Recommendations

1. **Registration Quality**: If registration QC shows distortions, consider:
   - Adjusting ANTs registration parameters
   - Using alternative template-to-template transforms

2. **Centroid Validation**: If >5% regions show >2mm error:
   - Investigate specific regions with large errors
   - Consider region-specific registration refinement

3. **Overlap Analysis**: Unexpected overlaps may indicate:
   - Registration inaccuracies
   - Need for atlas boundary refinement
